## Known issues

- Cannot see local image files like `<img src="./image1.jpg" />` or `<img src="file:///C:/image1.jpg" />`
  - This is Obsidian's constraint, it disallow to directly access local files through HTML code.
  - One of the possible remedy ways is re-save the HTML file as a complete HTML file by dedicated browser extensions such as "[SingleFile](https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile)", it can save a complete page (with CSS, images, fonts, frames, etc.) as a single HTML file. After got the complete HTML file, put it to obsidian-html-plugin installed vault folder then open it, you would see all images.
  - Another remedy way is add `app://local/` or `app://local//` prefix string to `src` attribute by hands(refer to "[Allow embed of Local images using `![](file:///...)`](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/allow-embed-of-local-images-using-file/1990/4)"). However, this workaround code would be sanitized out after version 1.0.1 of obsidian-html-plugin, you shall take obsidian-html-plugin 1.0.0 to make it work.
